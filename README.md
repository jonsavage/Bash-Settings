# Bash-Commands (OSX)
Some scripts that I use...

Installation:
If you are using a .bash_rc or a .bash_profile you can copy and paste these scripts into your respective .bash_rc or .bash_profile. If you're super cool you can instead create a sererate .bash_scripts file and then add 'source .bash_scripts' to your rc or profile file.
